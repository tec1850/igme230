      <p class="indented">
        I started the project off using a w3 template with w3-classes but soon realized that it was heavily reliant on classes rather
        than CSS. I also was relying on the help pages in order to write any code because I didn't know as much about w3
        classes as I did about CSS. After about 2 hours of trying to adjust the template, I realized that I wouldn't be able
        to add as much of my own content due to my lack of knowledge and time to learn. For that reason, I scrapped what
        I had and started over with a very basic, responsive template from w3schools.com but later scrapped that as well
        and decided to code the framework of the website myself.
      </p>
      <p class="indented">
        My approach to coding the website after starting over the second time was to design the landing page and then rest of the
        site around that general design. I spent a lot of time making sure the website was mobile friendly (resize the window!)
        - images, text and buttons scale correctly anlong with the nav bar that switches to a drop-down at screen-size of
        840px. I wrote a Javascript function to properly resize the "HUMAN EXPERIENCE" section of the landing page so that
        it would take up the entire page whenever the user resizes the page. I also used the JavaScript ASO library - noted
        in the references - to animate the landing page when the user scrolls. After coding the homepage, I went on to code
        each various application.
      </p>
      <p class="indented">
        The site's overall theme is about experiencing things that the average human doesn't typically get to experience. On the
        landing page, the user is be able to choose from 3 different "experiences". The three applications, (a.k.a "experiences",)
        I coded are: what it would be like to space travel, exploring the depths of the ocean, as well as what it would be
        like to be on the tallest mountain.
      </p>
      <p class="indented">
        Each of the application pages used the same general wireframe of HTML, the only difference between them being the various
        applications. I largely used code applications I found online - noted in references - however, not without changing
        the Js, html, and CSS generously and learning a great deal while doing so - noted below. I modified the specifications
        of each application in order for them work and fit into the theme I was going for properly. I also modified the css
        and html to make the application fit correctly onto the webpage.
      </p>
      <p class="indented">
        The HTML canvas was used for the space application as well as large amount of javascript. The application works by following
        the user's cursor and generates "stars" accordingly, and animating them "toward" the inverse of the cursor's x and
        y coordinate locations. The user can also click the screen using any mouse buttons to go into "hyperspeed" a.k.a
        create a trail behind each star. The Marianas Trench application heavily relied on css animations - keyframing was
        all done in the css. This application works by having a clear photo in the background and setting the same background
        image to the various bubbles. A blurry image is then coded inline to the original, masking it while the bubbles provide
        some clarity. The user can click the buttons in the top-left corner to toggle the blurry photo's style display: none
        and be greeted by your friendly shark! The Mount Everest application relied almost entirely on javascript. The application
        automatically pans to the right, waiting for the click event to allow the user to drag the picture. The javascript
        also wraps the photo to create a sphere, allowing the user to feel like they are actually there.
      </p>
      <p class="indented">
        Upon working on this project, I learned a lot about classes, divs, animations and inheritance, especially when coding the
        homepage. I learned about inheritance and what how children inherit attributes from the parents, what priority, as
        well as how to go about implementing meaningful code around the concept. I learned how HTML canvas works as well
        as how to implement it. In terms of javascript, I learned more about its syntax, how it's implemented and how it
        reacts to HTML.
